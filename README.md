Example: Power BI Desktop – The primary platform for designing, visualizing, and publishing the interactive dashboard.
Power Query – Used for cleaning, transforming, and shaping raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis.< br />
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Applied to build custom calculated columns and measures for dynamic KPIs such as Total Sales, Total Profit, Average Shipping Time, and Monthly Trends.< br />
Data Modeling – Relationships established among multiple tables (Orders, Customers, Products, Ship Modes, and Regions) to support seamless drill-through and cross-filtering interactions.< br />
Custom Visuals – Leveraged Power BI’s custom visuals for enhanced data representation, such as donut charts, maps, and KPI cards. < br />
Geographic Mapping – Integrated geographic data visualization using Power BI’s map visuals to display regional performance and profitability across U.S. states.< br />
Slicers and Filters – Enabled user-driven interactivity through slicers for region, category, segment, and shipping mode to allow for flexible analysis.< br />

# Data Source
The dataset used in this project was obtained from a publicly shared resource linked in a Power BI tutorial on YouTube. The data was sourced via Google Drive:
